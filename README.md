Monobox - A Single Solution to Supercharge Your Creativity and Productivity

## Inspiration
In a world with a plethora of productivity tools, we recognized a critical need for a unified solution that could cater to all our requirements in a single place. This need was particularly pressing for creative professionals whose time and output are intrinsically linked to their efficiency and productivity. 


## What it does
By combining many tools into a single platform, this device can help creatives work more efficiently. This features a to-do list and a minimal AI-based text editor. When a person joins the website, this web application gathers their details, which aids in understanding the user. 
Also, blogs are there to add value. Currently, a core feature we planned, automatic task prioritization is not implemented. Will be adding it soon.

## How we built it
We used Bootstrap for most of the front-end designs, The backend database is designed with NocoDB, a low-code Database platform, We used Firebase for storing the to-do list.  And a platform called Novel to act as our AI-based text editor(We hosted it, Yeey). 


## Challenges we ran into
* Don't have enough Open AI API credits to run queries to make automatic text writing in Novel
* Novel throwing in random errors while trying to host it.
*  Designing the UI for the landing website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Built a whole webpage with Bootstrap
* Hosted novel on our own.
* All the things currently working are available to use publically.

## What we learned
* Learned to host novel on our own, surviving several bugs.
* Learned to integrate different things into a full-fledged app
* Learned about connecting NocoDB via webhooks to enable further customer transactions


## What's next for 9_Build A Byte_Mono box
* Need to add authentication via Google Auth.
* Improve the onboarding workflow
* Adding automatic task scheduling as per the schedule of the corresponding person.
